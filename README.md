# Niko Home Control II Home Assistant Integration

License: [MIT](LICENSE)

This custom component will allow you to integrate you Niko Connected Controller II in Home Assistant.
You can use a touchscreen profile or the Hobby API account.

This integration communicates directly with the controller. You only need internet when activating/renewing the Hobby
API. If you use a touch screen profile, this isn't even needed.

**IMPORTANT**: There is an issue with the touch profiles, so the only supported way to configure the controller is the
Niko Hobby API.

## Acknowledgements

This custom component is a [spin-off of the hard and excellent work by @filipvh](https://github.com/filipvh/hass-nhc2).
Thanks!

A big thanks to Johan and Koen from Niko for their support and providing the test equipment.

Some people who made this possible, and should be mentioned:

* @nexus256
* @joleys
* @tijsverkoyen

## What works now?

Everything is developed against the Niko documentation. The version that was used can be found
at [docs/documentation.pdf](./docs/documentation.pdf).

### General

The integration provides multiple devices and entities. See below for a list of entities that each type of device
exposes.

#### Entities

The integration itself exposes the following entities:

* **Latest Controller Config Update Entity**, If you upload a new configuration to your controller you need to restart
  Home Assistant. Otherwise the integration will not work correctly. This entity will be on when a new configuration is
  loaded.

### NHC Access Control Action

This action is exposed as a switch (if supported), and a lock (if supported)

#### Entities

* **Lock**, (only if supported), used to unlock the doorlock.
* **Basic State Enum Sensor**, (only if supported), This is only available for ring-and-come-in routine. It
  indicates if the ring-and-come-in is enabled or not. The switch uses the same information but will not
  take `Intermediate` into account.

* **AllOff Active Binary Sensor**, Is on only upon activation of the action. Off when one of the assigned participants
  in the action had a state change. Be aware that this state is only updated as the button is pressed, not when all
  devices are off.

Totals can be calculated via a Helper:

Goto 'Settings' > 'Devices & Services' and click 'Helpers' at the top. Click the '+ Create Helper' button at the bottom
right and select 'Integration - Riemann sum integral sensor'. Type a name for the Helper and select the relevant '
energyhome' entity (i.e. 'Electrical Power to Grid') from the 'Input sensor' dropdown. Integration method 'Trapezoidal
rule' should give the most accurate integrated value. Set 'Precision' to '3' and set the 'Metric prefix' to 'k (kilo)'.
Leave the time unit at 'Hours'.

At least two helpers are needed: one for the consumption total and one for the production total.
These helpers can be used in the HA Energy Dashboard.

  production is greater than the threshold of 300W (+ 5W hysteresis)
* **Disable Report Instant Usage Re-enabling Switch**, a toggle to disable the automatic re-enabling of the
  Report Instant Usage property. This is useful if you don't need Electrical Power reporting.

## How to get it running

Note: Make sure you have a recent version of Home Assistant!

This integration is not part of the default Home Assistant installation.

The easiest way to install it is through [HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)](https://hacs.xyz/). Once you have HACS
installed you can search for "Niko Home Control II". Make sure you select the correct one. Ours has the following
description:

> Home Assistant Custom integration for Niko Home Control II

Once this is done you can install the integration in Home Assistant:

1. Go to Settings → Devices & Services Integrations
2. Add an integration, search for Niko Home Control II, and click on it
3. Follow the wizard

## FAQ

### The integration is not working after power outage

It is expected behouviour that the integration may not work after a power outage. Please restart Home Assistant. or
after a new configuration is uploaded.

### The integration is not working after uploading a new configuration

if you uploaded a new configuration to the connected controller / hub, please restart Home Assistant.

### The integration is not working after an IP change

Please make sure that the IP of the connected controller / hub does not change. If the IP changes you will need to
remove and re-add the integration.

### I see a lot of "Report Instant Usage re-enabled" messages in the log

This will only appear in the logs if you have set your log-level to `debug`.

The Electricity Metering module (with clamp), Energy Home, NHC Zigbee Smart plug and Generic Zigbee Smart plug only
report their power usage for 30 seconds when the "Report Instant Usage" is enabled. So as soon as it becomes disabled
this integration re-enables it.

### I see "Class CocoXXX not found" in the log

This is because this device is not supported (yet) or this device can't be controlled through the API.

Feel free to create an [issue on Github](https://github.com/joleys/niko-home-control-II/issues). Please include your
[device list](#i-need-to-see-the-device-list).

### I don't have/use the Energy Home, but it is present in the integration

Each installation exposes an Energy Home device. At this point there is no good way to detect if the Energy Home is
used.

If you do not want to see / record / ... you can disable the device in the integration.

### I need to see the device list

First you will need to enable debug logging for the integration. You can enable debug logging for this integration by
adding the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.nhc2: debug
```

When this is done you will need to restart Home Assistant. After that you can see the device list in the logs. You can
find it by searching for `Received device list:`. The device list itself is a large JSON string.

If you don't feel comfortable sharing this device list in a public issue, you can send it to me via
mail: `niko-ha [at] verkoyen [dot] eu`.

## Development

### Adding support for new Device models

* Add a new class for the device in `nhccoco/devices`. The name of the file is `{model}_{type}.py`. The classname is
  `Coco{Model}{Type}`.
* Import the class in `nhccoco/coco.py`. This allows the Coco class to create an instance when the device is present in
  the device list.
* Create the needed entities in `entities`
* Add the entities that should be created in the correct platform-file.

### Testing without having the real devices?

If you don't own a device but want to test the integration, and you have the relevant device info (eg. through a device
list your received). You can fake the devices returned from the MQTT broker.

1. Create a folder `debugging` in the root of the project.
2. Add the device list json in this folder.
3. Open [coco.py](./custom_components/nhc2/nhccoco/coco.py)
4. Search for `def _process_devices_list(self, response):` and edit the code to look like:

```python
def _process_devices_list(self, response):
    """Convert the response of devices.list into device instances."""
    _LOGGER.debug(f'Received device list: {response}')

    # REMOVE ME START
    from pathlib import Path
    import ast

    path = Path(str(Path(__file__).parent.resolve()) + '/../../../debugging/device_list.json').resolve()
    f = open(path)
    response = ast.literal_eval(f.read())
    # REMOVE ME END
```

__Remark:__ This is a hackish way, and you will not able to test it for real. You will not receive updates. Check the
logs to see if messages are correctly send to the MQTT broker.

## Found a bug?

If you found a bug you can create an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/joleys/niko-home-control-II/issues).

Before creating an issue:

1. Check if the issue is already reported
2. Make sure you are running the latest version of Home Assistant.
3. Make sure you are running the latest version of this integration.

If you create an issue:

* Mention which version of Home Assistant you are using.
* Include relevant logs from Home Assistant. You can enable debug logging for this integration by adding the following
  to
  your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.nhc2: debug
```

* If possible include the steps to reproduce the issue. Explain what is wrong and what you expected to happen.

## Want to help?

As you can see in this README, there are still untested devices. These are devices that are implemented based on the
available documentation from Niko. If you own one of these devices, please help me out by testing it. Let us know,
through an issue, what is working or not.

If you see missing features, feel free to create pull requests. Add missing devices, ...
